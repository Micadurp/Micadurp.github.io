Hey! My name is Nicholas but I am also known online on various media as Micadurp or Arzul. 
I am currently looking to start a career as a game programmer as previously I have only professionally worked in the Telecom industry. 
I have studied game programming at BTH but I have ended my education there a year early due to getting a job programming at Ericsson through HiQ. 
The practical application my skills appealed to me a lot more than the theoretical that I had left at BTH. 
However, some of the most fun I have had with programming is when I worked in groupprojects within school where we created a videogame from scratch!

In my freetime I play a large variety of games, watch various series, both animated and not, and I read a bunch of manga. 
I generally play more multiplayer games than singleplayer but enjoy most types of games. 
I also have a few boardgames that I play occasionally when I am able to get a few friends together.
