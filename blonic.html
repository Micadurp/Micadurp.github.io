	This was a small school project at BTH where we developed a game from the ground up including the game engine. 
	The project was around 2-3 months work, 20 hours a week, with 3 programmers and 3 technical artists to develop it. 
	Made in C++ and uses DirectX for Rendering, no other libraries used. I did most of the physics and had a large part in the setting up the groundwork for the engine (Shaders, Graphics, Reading/Loading files, collision, all that stuff)
	There are no plans of finishing this project.
	This is very old code and is also very unpolished, view at own risk: <a href="https://github.com/Micadurp/Blonic-The-Hooker">Blonic</a>!

	I also spent a moment to recreate some of the swinging in the Unreal Engine.
